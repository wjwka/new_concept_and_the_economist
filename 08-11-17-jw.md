Something about Stockholm syndrome

After finishing Data mining and Advanced Algorithm examinations, I actually felt like losing something, even though these two things were actually a torture to me when I had to study hard to try to pass them and to get the credits.

Stockholm syndrome is a coondition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survial strategy during capacity. These feelings, resulting from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time spent togethter, are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or ridk endured by the victims. Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of "strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other".

 It feels like the courses were acutally hoding my whole life as a hostage and I really feel like intimate to them. When it's over, I might have no chance to see them again in the upcoming life, like breaking up with some guy.

 Maybe here is the rub: why does these knowledge loom so sexy?? And why do I even bother to screw around with them?? end up so broken..
