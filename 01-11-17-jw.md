**"who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world"**

"I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it's just too much. The current's too strong. They've got to let go, drift apart. That's how it is with us. It's a shame, Kath, because we've loved each other all our lives. But in the end, we can't stay together forever.

"I'm interested in memory because it's a filter through which we see our lives, and because it's foggy and obscure, the opportunities for self-deception are there.

"Many of our deepest motives come, not from an adult logic of how things work in the world, but out of something that is frozen from childhood.

"Memory, I realize, can be an unreliable thing; often it is heavily coloured by the circumstances in which one remembers.

"If you are under the impression you have already perfected yourself, you will never rise to the heights you are no doubt capable of.

"It was like when you make a move in chess and just as you take your finger off the piece, you see the mistake you've made, and there's this panic because you don't know yet the scale of disaster you've left yourself open to.

"All children have to be deceived if they are to grow up without trauma.

"Love isn't about when you first meet. It's about the many, many years you spend together, when you're trying to keep that flame burning.

**"Donâ€™t you wonder sometimes, what might have happened if you tried?"
