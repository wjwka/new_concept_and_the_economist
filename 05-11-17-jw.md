I woke up at 3.30 am, and started working at 4, which reminded me of something my friend happens to tease me with.

Of course, Chinese know better to work 18 hours a day and 8 days a week.

Actually, I kinda agreed with him..

China has a extremly large population, but the we can not really feel the varity of personalities. On the contrary, we are more like the products produced by the same flowline, or maybe it's just me being self-deprecating?

I read something from Linkedin earlier today(6 am), 'Chinese are like the tin woodman in the *wonderful wizard in OZ*, always finding a heart'. I felt it really mean something and I did some further reading.

The Importance of Just Being:

I was one of the many with an addiction who had learned to act mindlessly. This is not to say that my behavior was without reason. Far from it.

I always had good reasons to get wasted. I was feeling anxious and told myself I couldn't cope, or I was angry and couldn't see the point, or I was happy and felt like celebrating. In fact, I had an inexhaustible supply of reasons.

I had learned a coping strategy that enabled me to manage my condition. Just like learning to drive or making coffee in the morning, I behaved on autopilot, without awareness of my own behavior.

There's nothing wrong with this psychological process. It's an important part of being able to function. If every time you got behind the wheel or wanted a coffee you had to consciously relearn the process, your day would soon become totally unmanageable.

Autopilot behavior like this is learned by repetition and sits in our subconscious, ready to be put into action when we need it. This is fine as long as the behavior benefits us and moves us toward the things that we need. Like driving us to work.

The problem comes when the behavior not only takes us away from the things we value but also starts to create more problems than it solves.

This was the nature of my addiction. Beyond the physical dependency (brutal but relatively short lived through medical detox), I discovered that my sense of self had been replaced by a yearning to be someone or something else. Something not me. Not me at all.

I'd developed an obsession with wanting to become—become free from anxiety; become a more interesting person; become relaxed; become fulfilled; become happy.

It was my desperation to change that led me to stay the same for ten years. 

How Living In The Now Changes Everything

Acting mindfully and being aware of the now changed everything for me. As Eckhart Tolle so wisely wrote, **“…the past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.”**

I discovered that I am not who I think I am.

My thoughts are my own but they do not describe me. Because I think or feel anxious, that doesn't mean that I am anxious. It means I am experiencing the symptoms of anxiety, not that I am anxiety.

If I am aware of now, then I notice these symptoms as they elevate my heart rate, dry my mouth, place intrusive thoughts in my mind, and push me toward “fight or flight response.”

By noticing these sensations, I can be an observer of them and no longer a slave to them. I choose to identify them and give them a name. I choose to look at them in their stupid faces. Yes, it's uncomfortable, but I have learned to be comfortable with feeling uncomfortable.

I do not need to compensate for the things I feel or believe because they are simply thoughts and sensations that cannot harm me.

If we are self-aware and mindful of behavior, then we can exercise choice over what we do right now. We can act not in response to the pressure of our thoughts and feelings, but because we are aware of what we value.

Noticing is key. If we don't notice what's happening, then we can't have a choice over how we respond to those things (whatever they may be).

If I go to a room I've never been in before, open the door, and meet a person I've never met before who then tells me that I look ugly, I will have an emotional response. I can no more control those circumstances or my emotional response than I can the orbit of the planets.

By noticing my reaction, I can accept my thoughts, feelings, and the reality of my situation. If I don't, I will probably just react to the way I feel. Perhaps I'll cry, shout abuse, or even take a substance to “help me calm down.” However, if I am aware and I notice what's going on for me, then I have another option.

I can pause before I act. I can choose my behavior based upon my awareness of both the situation and what matters to me.

I have let go of trying to change the way I feel, and of trying to become something or someone else. I am simply living in the now, and I know that only my behavior shapes my destiny, regardless of my thoughts.

I am aware of my behavior and I can control it; and, in doing so, I am living my life with purpose.

If like me, you have struggled or are currently struggling with anxiety, mindfulness could help you, as well. You are not your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. You don’t need to try so hard to control them; you just need to accept them and come into the present moment so you can control what you do."
