My 'polished by masters' essay kindled my interest in english writing, even in this extremly panicking exam week. This was not taken seriously by me before, however I now feel obliged to improve. As proved by other courses, it is easier to accumulate the knowledge than to keep them. Also, I read something said by an author earlier today, 'to read, to write, I see no shortcut here'. Thus, it is easy to see that the only thing that one should do to engender the expected effect is to stuff himself with the very kind of knowledge and to keep practicing. Trying to be the first to spot the change of oneself and not to be smug about the delightful achievements after the long and desperate struggle should also be concerned but later.

Intuitively one might expect such considerable efforts either to 极端 or 另一个极端, rather than 表现平平, at best 上限, at worst 下限. Although one could easily be disturbed by the sharp contrast between these two possible results, a more likely senario is that I myself will be the first to seize my writings and tear them up after reading articles from the journals.

From other's perspective, the change takes milliseconds. From yours, it takes lifetimes. Put oneself in other's position, never corner an opponent, and always assist him to save his face.(wtf..)
