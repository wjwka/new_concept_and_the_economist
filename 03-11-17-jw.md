#Lesson 23 One man's meat is another man's poison

People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be eaten. If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus 章鱼 a great delicacy. You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.

The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.

Snails would, of course, be the main dish. I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.

To our dismay(沮丧), we saw that there were snails everywhere: they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall! I had never been able to look at a snail since then.
