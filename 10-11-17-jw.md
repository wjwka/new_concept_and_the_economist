sagas: lengend, a narrative telling the adventures of a hero or a familiy
The only way that they can perserve their history is to recount it as sagas lengends handed down from one generation to another.

These lengends are useful because they can tell us something about people who lived long ago.

But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas if they had any, are forgotten.
