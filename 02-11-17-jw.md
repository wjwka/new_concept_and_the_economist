Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844 - 1900)

a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history--wikipedia

Fans of Nietzsche are always seen as zhong'er'bing in China. But I think, part of his readers are not reading his work as philosiphy work, they are reading poems actually. At least for me, they are actually poems on philosophy.

here are some of his famous selections:


That which does not kill us makes us stronger.

Faith: not wanting to know what the truth is.

He who has a strong enough why can bear almost any how.

It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages. 

Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen.

Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one.
When you look long into an abyss, the abyss looks into you.

Morality is the herd instinct in the individual.
